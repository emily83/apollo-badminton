After several weeks at Canterbury Academy, we will be back at St Anselm's on Thursday 13th July with 4 courts to play on!

This is the start of our summer club when we welcome our hall to all players of all standards so please bring along newbies who are keen to play or invite friends from other clubs who would like games.

Just £5 pay and play for 2 ½ hours of court time. Bargain! test
