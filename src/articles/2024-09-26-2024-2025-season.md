T﻿he 2024/2025 season is now underway and it’s great to see some new members joining us! The season runs from September - May with a 2 week break over Christmas. As we play in a school the hall is sometimes unavailable to us during open evenings and exams, but we will always endeavour to find an alternative venue.

We have entered a Composite and a Men's 4 team into the North foreland league this season. Home matches are played on Thursday nights at St Anselm’s. The season’s fixtures and results can be found on our [Fixtures](/fixtures) page.

It is £100 to join for the season and this includes your Badminton England membership and also a club t-shirt (if you're a new member) to wear for matches. This is not compulsory but it is nice when a team are all unified. Please contact us for details of how to pay.

If you haven't already, please find us on Facebook as Mike will regularly post updates about halls/timings etc and also his famous match reports accompanied with flattering match pictures.
