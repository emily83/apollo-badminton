#### The Badminton England Insurance is mandatory when joining a club. You can pay through Apollo or another club you are a member of.  

Match fees will be £6. Our new match night will be **TUESDAY EVENINGS 7:30-10:00pm**. As our membership has grown and club nights have become busier, we want to reduce the match nights on a Thursday leaving us with just 2 courts for club night. We are hoping to enter 4 teams into the league this year – this will be approximately 22 home matches. There may be the occasional Thursday Match night as a back-up if needed.

### Summer club

S﻿ummer club has now come to an end. Thank you to all our members who have played and to all our visitors who have joined us over the summer.

Our 25/26 season will start at the beginning of September with matches soon commencing. If you are interested in joining our club please speak to a member of the committee – Jo, Allan, Jordan or Jim.

We are a busy competitive club who host a couple of social in-house tournaments throughout the year. Due to the standards of the league, we try to maintain a competitive standard during our league season so our members can practice for matches.
