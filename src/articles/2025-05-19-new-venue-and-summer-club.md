W﻿e are excited to announce that we have now moved to our new home of Barton Manor School Sports Centre on Spring Lane! This is a more modern hall and has the advantage of only closing for exams for 4 weeks over the summer so we get to play more badminton!

T﻿he move has coincided with our Summer Club commencing. This will run for 14 weeks from May to the end of August, 7:30-9:30pm (possibly until 10pm some nights).

It will be £10 a night for pay and play, or for our members and current regular visitors it will be £84 upfront to attend all summer (£6 a night). Our summer club is open to all members and visitors.

B﻿elow are the dates for Summer Club

- Thursday 8th May
