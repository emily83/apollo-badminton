Thursday 7thÂ September is the start of our 23/24 membership season. This runs from September - May with a 2 week break over Christmas. As we play in a school the hall is sometimes unavailable to us during open evenings and exams, but we will always endeavour to find an alternative venue. 

We have entered a Mixed and a Men's team into the North foreland league this season, and Jim is busy scheduling matches. With such a successful summer club and new members joining this is brilliant for our teams. There will be a list of reserves also and with the divisions being so large all of the reserves should be getting games too. If this momentum continues we are hopeful to enter a Composite again and possibly a Ladies team for next season....but that's me just getting excited and carried awayÂ ðŸ™‚Â 

It is going to be a great season and I want to welcome all of our new players. It is Â£100 to join for the season and this includes your BE membership and also a club t-shirt (if you're a new member) to wear for matches. This is not compulsory but it is nice when a team are all unified. Please contact us for details of how to pay.

If you haven't already, please find us on Facebook as Mike will regularly post updates about halls/timings etc and also his famous match reports accompanied with flattering match pictures. Also, if you take any photos of club nights, please forward them to me so Emily can add them onto our newly updated website.
